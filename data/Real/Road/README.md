# Downloading Road Graphs and Queries

As mentioned in Section 5.3 of our paper, we generate graphs of the road networks of the cities Brno, Porto, Rome and San Francisco. Also, as mentioned in Section 5.1, we generate node pairs as queries for each graph. The query files are named `<city>.queries`. Owing to space limitations, the graph files are compressed with a password. They can be decompressed using the command below:
```
unzip <city>.zip
```
Running the above command and typing the password will generate the uncompressed graph file named `<city>.graph`.
The format of the generated graph and query files is mentioned [here](../../README.md).

This work is currently under submission to VLDB 2020, and hence the password has been made available only to the reviewers. If you are interested in these graphs, kindly send an email to <saha0003@e.ntu.edu.sg> requesting the password.
