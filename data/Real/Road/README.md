# Downloading Road Graphs and Queries

As mentioned in Section 5.3 of our paper, we generate graphs of the road networks of the cities Brno, Porto, Rome and San Francisco. Also, as mentioned in Section 5.1, we generate node pairs as queries for each graph. These graphs and queries are available here. The graph files are named `<city>.graph` and the query files are named `<city>.queries`.

The format of the generated graph and query files is mentioned [here](../README.md).
